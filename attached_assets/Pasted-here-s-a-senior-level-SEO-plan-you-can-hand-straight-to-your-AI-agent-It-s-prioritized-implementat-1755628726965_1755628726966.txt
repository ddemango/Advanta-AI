here’s a senior-level SEO plan you can hand straight to your AI agent. It’s prioritized, implementation-ready, and tailored to rank an About page (and improve sitewide trust).

1) Highest-impact quick wins (do first)

URL & indexability: use /about (not /about-us-123), set <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.advanta-ai.com/about" />, ensure no noindex.

Title & meta:

Title: About Advanta AI & Founder Davide DeMango | AI Automation with Measurable Outcomes (≤ 60 chars if you prefer: About Advanta AI | Founder Davide DeMango)

Meta description: Advanta AI turns AI into measurable results—clean data, smart automation, and simple interfaces. Meet founder Davide DeMango and see why we built it.

H1 + header hierarchy: one H1 only: About Advanta AI. H2s for: What we do, Founded by Davide DeMango, Why I built Advanta AI, Values, Free Tools, FAQ.

Internal links (contextual): add 6–10 internal links with descriptive anchors:

From homepage hero/footer: “About Advanta AI”

From services pages: “Our founder’s approach”, “Why we built Advanta”

From each free tool: “Who built these tools?” → /about

From blog posts: “About Advanta AI” / “Meet Davide DeMango”

Add 4–6 trust elements: authenticated headshot, client mentions, awards/press, privacy/ethics blurb, contact CTA, and your two trust quotes.

2) Content blocks to include on the page

Founder paragraph (you’ve got it) + “Why I built Advanta AI” section (done).

Mini case snapshots (3 tiles): Problem → What we built → Result (include a metric if possible).

FAQ (targets People-Also-Ask; answers ~50–75 words):

What does Advanta AI do?

Who is Davide DeMango?

Are there free tools?

How does your pilot work?

How do you handle data privacy?

Last updated date (visible), e.g., “Updated: August 2025”.

5) Technical & performance (Core Web Vitals)

LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1 on mobile.

Serve hero/headshot as AVIF/WebP with srcset and explicit width/height; lazy-load below-the-fold images.

Inline critical CSS for the about fold; defer non-critical JS.

Use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, gzip/br, long-cache immutable assets, and a fast edge CDN.

6) Internal linking map (sitewide tasks)

Add “About” to the main nav and footer.

Link from /free-tools, /pricing, and top blog posts with descriptive anchors (“why we built it”, “meet the founder”).

On the About page, link out to: /pricing, /free-tools, 2–3 relevant blog posts, and your contact page.

7) Off-page trust & E-E-A-T boosters

Create/update LinkedIn Company and Founder profiles; ensure name, logo, and URL match your site (use sameAs in schema).

Publish one founder interview or guest post; link back to /about.

Add business listings (Crunchbase, Product Hunt launch post, relevant industry directories) with consistent NAP.

Encourage 2–3 public testimonials with a named person + company (link to their profile).

8) Tracking & monitoring

Verify Search Console and submit sitemap.

Track /about in GA4 (scroll-depth, outbound clicks to LinkedIn, demo CTA).

Monitor keywords: advanta ai, about advanta ai, davide demango, advanta ai founder, ai automation agency nashville (or your target geo).

Set alerts for Core Web Vitals regressions on /about.
