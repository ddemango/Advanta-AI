Here’s an advanced, no-fluff Admin Dashboard spec for Advanta-AI that you can hand to your devs/AI agent and build in phases. I split it into pages, KPIs, data objects, and “done means done” checklists so nothing gets missed.

Top-Level Structure (left nav)

Overview (CEO view)

Users & Accounts (CRM/tenants)

Billing & Plans

Projects & Workflows (AI jobs)

Models & Prompts (LLM ops)

Content & Tools (site tools, blog, templates)

Analytics (product + marketing)

Growth Ops (A/B tests, SEO, funnels)

Automation & Schedules

Integrations & Data Sources

Support & Quality

Security, Audit, & Settings

1) Overview (Executive Home)

Widgets/KPIs

MRR / ARR, net revenue, churn, expansion, LTV, CAC, payback

Active users (DAU/WAU/MAU), New signups, Conversion rate

Top products/tools used, Top workflows run, Avg run time, Error rate

GPT & API spend (today / 7d / 30d), cost per action

Incidents & SLAs (open, breaching soon), queue backlog

Live status: APIs (OpenAI/Supabase/Stripe/etc.), rate limits, latency
Actions

“Create announcement” (sitewide banner)

“Start experiment” (A/B test wizard)

“Trigger reindex/retrain” (content/embeddings)

2) Users & Accounts (CRM/Tenancy)

Tables & Views

Accounts (company, plan, seats, MRR, health score)

Users (role, last seen, verification, 2FA status)

Usage (runs, tokens, storage, bandwidth)

Activity timeline (events, payments, support tickets)
Bulk actions

Plan upgrades/downgrades, add seats, credit grants, resets

Suspend/reactivate, invite links, SSO mapping
Health scoring

Inputs: weekly active days, workflows created, first value time, ticket sentiment

Output: Red/Amber/Green + playbooks (nudge, concierge setup, “power unlock” email)

3) Billing & Plans

Plans/Entitlements: features toggles per tier (API limits, tool access, white-label, SSO)

Coupons, trials, proration, metered usage (per run / tokens / storage)

Invoices, refunds, dunning, failed payment recovery automation

Revenue dashboards by cohort/plan/source

4) Projects & Workflows (Your core product)

Objects
