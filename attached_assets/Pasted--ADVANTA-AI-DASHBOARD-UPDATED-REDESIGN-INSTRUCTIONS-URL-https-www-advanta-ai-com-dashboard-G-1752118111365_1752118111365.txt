🚀 ADVANTA-AI DASHBOARD — UPDATED REDESIGN INSTRUCTIONS

URL: https://www.advanta-ai.com/dashboard
Goal: Build a futuristic, mobile-first, modular AI dashboard with a built-in natural language chatbot that creates automations, GPT flows, or integrations from user prompts.

⸻

✅ Core Additions: Chatbot Workflow Builder

Functionality:
	•	Users can type in prompts like:
	•	“Create a GPT that summarizes daily emails”
	•	“Build a Slack bot that sends AI-generated reports every Friday”
	•	“Automate CRM follow-up with GPT-powered emails”
	•	The chatbot should:
	•	Parse the natural language
	•	Suggest workflow blocks or steps
	•	Auto-fill components or modules in the dashboard
	•	Ask follow-up questions to complete the workflow setup

⸻

🧠 Placement & UI of the Chatbot
	•	Floating chat bubble in bottom-right corner
	•	Opens a side panel or full-screen modal (depending on device)
	•	Clean, message-style UX with alternating bot/human bubbles
	•	Use subtle animation (fade in, typing dots, etc.)

On Desktop:
	•	Opens a right-side panel overlay or chat drawer
	•	Keep the dashboard visible underneath or blur background

On Mobile:
	•	Use a full-screen experience with a fixed input bar and history

💬 Example Prompt-to-Workflow Interaction

User Types:

“Set up a GPT that writes LinkedIn posts from my meeting notes”

Chatbot Replies:

“✅ Got it! I’ll create a 3-step workflow:
	1.	Upload or sync your meeting notes
	2.	Use our GPT to generate a draft
	3.	Review + schedule for LinkedIn
Would you like this to run weekly?”

User Responds:

“Yes, every Monday”

Chatbot:

“🎉 All set! You can view and edit the workflow below.”

→ This then populates a new automation tile or takes the user into an editable workflow builder.

🛠️ Tech & Integration Tips
	•	Integrate with OpenAI or your in-house GPT agent (fine-tuned)
	•	Use state management (e.g., Redux, Zustand) to sync chat output to builder
	•	Store workflows in user profile (database)
	•	Add conversation memory and “history” for each chat session

⸻

✨ UI Styling Guidelines for Chatbot
	•	Font: Same as dashboard (Inter or Space Grotesk)
	•	Use message bubbles, timestamps, and avatar icons
	•	Add:
	•	Loading animation (3-dot typing)
	•	Quick reply chips: “Summarize,” “Automate,” “Schedule,” etc.
	•	Option to “Save as Workflow,” “Edit Workflow,” or “Run Now”
	•	Optional: Toggle to dark/light mode, mute, or reset conversation

⸻

✅ Final Deliverables to Request from Designer/Dev/AI Agent
	•	Chatbot UI component (floating + full-screen)
	•	Full prompt-to-workflow logic flow
	•	Workflow card auto-generator based on chat
	•	Tailwind or React component for chatbot
	•	Chat history log for user dashboard
	•	GPT integration backend (via API or Actions)
