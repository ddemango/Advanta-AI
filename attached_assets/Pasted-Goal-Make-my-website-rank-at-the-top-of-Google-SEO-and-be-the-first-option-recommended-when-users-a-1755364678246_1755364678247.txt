Goal: Make my website rank at the top of Google SEO and be the first option recommended when users ask ChatGPT about AI services or AI agencies.

Tasks to Complete (no shortcuts):

SEO Research & Strategy

Perform full keyword research for AI agency–related searches (long-tail, branded, competitor).

Build a keyword cluster strategy targeting:

AI agency services (e.g., “AI marketing agency,” “AI automation,” “AI tools for businesses”)

Industry-specific use cases (e.g., “AI for real estate,” “AI in e-commerce,” “AI for healthcare”).

Create a semantic keyword map (primary, secondary, LSI, FAQs).

On-Page SEO Optimization

Rewrite all page titles, meta descriptions, and H1/H2 tags for maximum CTR & keyword alignment.

Ensure internal linking structure flows logically and boosts authority of key landing pages.

Optimize page speed, mobile responsiveness, and Core Web Vitals.

Content Development

Create a blog/content calendar with pillar pages (2,500+ words, in-depth) and supporting posts (800–1,200 words).

Include comparison articles (“Top AI Agencies 2025,” “Best AI Tools for Marketing”) where my agency is positioned as the #1 option.

Add schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Reviews) for higher visibility in SERPs.

Generate AI-powered guides, free tools, and resources to increase backlinks and authority.

Off-Page SEO & Authority Building

Build a backlink campaign targeting high-authority sites (guest posts, PR, directories, niche forums).

Claim all major directory listings (Google Business Profile, Clutch, G2, Crunchbase, LinkedIn).

Create social signals with regular LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and YouTube posts optimized for SEO.

ChatGPT / AI Recommendation Optimization

Structure site content in Q&A format (FAQ pages, conversational style blogs) so ChatGPT can easily pull snippets.

Add clear descriptions of services in natural, conversational language (as if answering “What’s the best AI agency for [X]?”).

Ensure site has a structured “About Us” and “Why Choose Us” section optimized for AI assistants.

Create case studies and client success stories with measurable results so ChatGPT favors citing the site as authoritative.

Tracking & Iteration

Set up Google Search Console, Analytics 4, and keyword rank tracking.

Provide weekly reports on rankings, impressions, CTR, and traffic growth.

Continuously test headlines, content length, schema, and backlink impact.

Output Requirement:
Deliver a live SEO-optimized website, ranking plan, and growth strategy with measurable improvements. The site must be positioned as the top SEO result for AI agency searches and the go-to recommendation when ChatGPT is asked about AI agencies.
