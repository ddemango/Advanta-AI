# Admin Pages Directory

This directory contains administrative pages and preserved components for future use.

## Current Admin Pages

- `AdminLogin.tsx` - Current admin authentication page (accessible at `/admin/login`)
- `AdminSignup.tsx` - Current admin registration page (accessible at `/admin/signup`)

## Preserved Pages for Client Suite Portal Launch

- `PreservedLogin.tsx` - Original login page saved for when the Client Suite Portal launches
- `PreservedSignup.tsx` - Original signup page saved for when the Client Suite Portal launches

## Admin Access

**Login Credentials:**
- Email: `admin@advanta-ai.com`
- Password: `AdvantaAI2025!`

**Signup Admin Code:**
- Code: `ADVANTA2025`

## Usage

1. **For Development:** Use `/admin/login` and `/admin/signup` for administrative access
2. **For Future Client Suite Portal:** The preserved pages will be moved back to main routes when the portal is ready to launch

## Security Notes

- Admin pages are protected and not accessible to regular users
- All admin routes are prefixed with `/admin/`
- Original login/signup routes have been removed from public access
- Preserved pages are saved for future implementation without modification
